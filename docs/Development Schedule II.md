## How will the team go from MVP to Submission?
We aim to create a polished game with understandable and refined game mechanics. There should be 4 levels (2 tutorial and 2 main) with a conclusive start and finish narrative. There should be a thought out pacing of the game with challenges getting harder as the game progresses without the game getting boring. We will ask for people to playtest our game to get feedback on pacing and understandability of our mechanics.
